<p><b>1. include</b> "SomeFile.someextension"
<p>In general the file is treated as an FB source file.
<p><b>1a. Special treatment for C source and C header files (*.c and *.h)</b>
<p><b>include</b> "SomeFile.c"
<br><b>include</b> "SomeFile.h"
<p>Such files are copied to the build_temp folder. A #include statement is inserted in the translated FB code. This feature provides an alternative to #if def _PASSTHROUGHFUNCTION for mixing C with FB code.

<p><b>1b. Special treatment for C static libraries (*.a)</b>
<p><b>include</b> "MyLib.a"
<p>The include statement copies the library file to the build_temp folder; you must also place the name of the library file in the preferences 'More compiler options' field [this causes it to be linked]. The example below is for a library MyLib that exports one symbol (MyLibFunction).
<pre class="codeexample">
<b>include</b> "MyLib.a"
<b>BeginCDeclaration</b>
// let the compiler know about the function
void MyLibFunction( void ); // in lieu of .h file
<b>EndC</b>
<p>// let FBtoC know about the function
<b>toolbox</b> MyLibFunction()
MyLibFunction() // call the function
</pre>


<p><b>2. include resources</b> "SomeFile.someextension"
<p>The file indicated is copied from the FB source folder to the application's Contents/Resources/ directory, unless the extension is .nib in which case it is copied to Contents/Resources/en.lproj/. 
<p>This statement is the standard way to copy your sound (for example *.aiff), and image (for example *.icns) files into the application package. Nib files are handled by this statement, as an alternative to dragging them to your project window in FB5.


<p><b>3. include library</b>
<br>OS X frameworks may be specified with the 'include library' statement, which has two forms:

<p><b>include library</b> "Framework/Header.h"
<br><b>include library</b> "Framework" // optional short form, expanded internally to: include library "Framework/Framework.h"

<pre class="codeexample">
// tell the compiler the framework and header
<b>include library</b> "AddressBook/AddressBookUI.h"
// tell FBtoC the functions
<b>toolbox fn</b> ABPickerCreate() = ABPickerRef
...
</pre>

<p>The effect of 'include library' is to insert the appropriate #include preprocessor directive in the translated C file, and to pass the appropriate linker command to the compiler.

<p>The QuickTime framework is #included and linked by default; your source code does not need  include library "QuickTime". 
OpenGL is automatically #included and linked, if your project uses one of the relevant Headers files such as Tlbx gl.incl.
