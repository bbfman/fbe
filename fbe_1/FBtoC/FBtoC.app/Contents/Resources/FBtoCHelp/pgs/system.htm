<p>FBtoC works on OS X 10.6 and later.
<br>Before using FBtoC you should have installed Apple's free Developer Tools (a.k.a. Xcode Tools), from your OS X install CDs or DVD. 
<p></p>
<p>To create universal binaries, you must install the Cross-development SDKs. Without /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.6.sdk, only the native architecture of your Mac can be built. The Finder view (below) of the Developer folder shows the SDKs after installation. Cross-development is an optional part of the Xcode Tools install (from the OS X DVD or CDs).
