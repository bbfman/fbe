<hr>

<ul>
<li>The compiler has more powerful optimizations for speed than the old FB Compiler.app. 
<li>Native Intel code runs &asymp;3 times faster (or more)  than PPC code under Rosetta.
<li>Framework access is much simpler than in FB (see later).
<li>FBtoC can automatically copy specified files into the app's resources (see later).
<li>Apple's modern development tools work on apps built by FBtoC. Tools include the Xcode debugger, the performance analyser Shark and (in 10.5) Instruments.
<li>An app (window 1 : print "Hello, world!" : do HandleEvents : until gFBQuit) can be built as small as 36 KB (or 72K with the default icon).
<li>On an Intel Mac, crash reports are interpretable, unlike those of a legacy FB app.
<li>Unlike FB, there is no 32 KB limit on local function variables.
</ul>
