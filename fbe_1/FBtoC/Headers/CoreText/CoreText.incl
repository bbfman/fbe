Note that framework version is not always an accurate indicator of feature availability. The recommended way to use this function is first to check that the function pointer is non-NULL, followed by calling it and comparing its result to a defined constant (or constants). For example, to determine whether the CoreText API is available: if (&CTGetCoreTextVersion != NULL && CTGetCoreTextVersion() >= kCTVersionNumber10_5) { // CoreText API is available } @result The version number. This value is for comparison with the constants beginning with kCTVersionNumber.*/toolbox fn CTGetCoreTextVersion = UInt32//uint32_t// AVAILABLE_MAC_OS_X_VERSION_10_5_AND_LATER;
