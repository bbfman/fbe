If you require special features in your menu that the system menu    definition does not support, please mail <toolbox@apple.com> and describe your requirements;    we would much rather enhance the system menu definition than have you write a custom one.        Menu definition functions before Carbon used the following messages:            kMenuDrawMsg        kMenuChooseMsg        kMenuSizeMsg        kMenuPopUpMsg        kMenuDrawItemMsg        kMenuCalcItemMsg        kMenuThemeSavvyMsg            kMenuChooseMsg and kMenuDrawItemMsg are not supported in Carbon and are not sent to    Carbon menu definitions. In Carbon, kMenuChooseMsg is replaced by kMenuFindItemMsg and    kMenuHiliteItemMsg. Menu definition functions in Carbon use the following messages:            kMenuInitMsg        kMenuDisposeMsg        kMenuFindItemMsg        kMenuHiliteItemMsg        kMenuDrawItemsMsg        kMenuDrawMsg        kMenuSizeMsg        kMenuPopUpMsg        kMenuCalcItemMsg        kMenuThemeSavvyMsg            The rest of this documentation will focus on Carbon menu definitions only.        Menu Definition Messages            Carbon menu definition functions should support the following messages:                kMenuInitMsg                        menuRect        unused            hitPt           unused            whichItem       OSErr*                    Sent when a menu is created. This message gives the menu definition an opportunity            to initialize its own state. If the menu definition encounters an error while            initializing, it should set *whichItem to a non-zero error code; this will cause the            Menu Manager to destroy the menu and return an error back from the API that was used            to create the menu.                kMenuDisposeMsg                        menuRect        unused            hitPt           unused            whichItem       unused                        Sent when a menu is destroyed. This message gives the menu definition an opportunity            to destroy its own data.                    kMenuFindItemMsg                        menuRect        menu bounds            hitPt           point to hit-test            whichItem       MDEFFindItemData*                        Sent when the Menu Manager is displaying a menu and needs to know what item is under            the mouse. The whichItem parameter is actually a pointer to a MenuTrackingData structure.            On entry, the menu, virtualMenuTop, and virtualMenuBottom fields of this structure are            valid. The menu definition should determine which item containst the given point, if any,            and fill in the itemUnderMouse, itemSelected, and itemRect fields. If an item is found,            the menu definition should always fill in the itemUnderMouse and itemRect fields. The            menu definition should only fill in the itemSelected field if the item is available for            selection; if it is unavailable (because it is disabled, or for some other reason), the            menu definition should set the itemSelected field to zero.                        The values placed in the itemUnderMouse and itemSelected fields should be less than or            equal to the number of items returned by CountMenuItems on this menu. The values placed            in these two fields should be identical if both are non-zero. itemUnderMouse should always            be non-zero if the mouse is actually over an item.                        The menu definition should not hilite the found item during this message. The Menu             Manager will send a separate kMenuHiliteItemMsg to request hiliting of the item.                        If the menu definition supports scrolling, it should scroll the menu during this message,            and update the virtualMenuTop and virtualMenuBottom fields of the MenuTrackingData to            indicate the menu's new scrolled position.                        If the menu definition uses QuickDraw to draw while scrolling, it should draw into the            current port.                If the menu definition uses CoreGraphics to draw while scrolling, it should use the            CGContextRef passed in the context field of the MDEFHiliteItemData structure.                        Menu definitions must use the ScrollMenuImage API, if available, to scroll the menu contents.            This API is available in CarbonLib 1.5 and later, and in Mac OS X 10.1 and later. ScrollMenuImage            properly supports scrolling the alpha channel in the menu's image data. Use of QuickDraw's            ScrollRect API to scroll the menu contents will result in the alpha channel being set to 0xFF            (opaque) and the menu will no longer be transparent.                        The menu definition should not modify the menu field of the MenuTrackingData.                    kMenuHiliteItemMsg                    menuRect        menu bounds            hitPt           unused            whichItem       MDEFHiliteItemData*                        Sent when the Menu Manager is displaying a menu and needs to hilite a newly selected            item. The whichItem parameter is actually a pointer to a MDEFHiliteItemData structure.            The menu definition should unhilite the item in the previousItem field, if non-zero,            and hilite the item in the newItem field.                        Menu definitions should use the EraseMenuBackground API to erase the old menu contents            before unhiliting a menu item, if the menu definition is using the Appearance Manager's            menu drawing APIs. This is necessary because the background of a menu is transparent on            Aqua, and if the old hilite is not erased first, it will show through the new unhilited            menu background.                        If the menu definition uses QuickDraw to draw, it should draw into the current port.                If the menu definition uses CoreGraphics to draw, it should use the CGContextRef passed            in the context field of the MDEFHiliteItemData structure.                    kMenuDrawItemsMsg                    menuRect        menu bounds            hitPt           unused            whichItem       MDEFDrawItemsData*                        Sent when the Menu Manager is displaying a menu and needs to redraw a portion of the            menu. This message is used by the dynamic menu item support code in the Menu Manager;            for example, if items five and six in a menu are a dynamic group, the Menu Manager will            send a DrawItems message when the group's modifier key is pressed or released to redraw            the appropriate item, but no other items in the menu.                        The whichItem parameter for this message is actually a pointer to a MDEFDrawItemsData            structure. The menu definition should redraw the items starting with firstItem and            ending with lastItem, inclusive.                        If the menu definition uses QuickDraw to draw, it should draw into the current port.                If the menu definition uses CoreGraphics to draw, it should use the CGContextRef passed            in the context field of the MDEFDrawItemsData structure.                    kMenuDrawMsg                        menuRect        menu bounds            hitPt           unused            whichItem       MDEFDrawData*                        Sent when the Menu Manager is displaying a menu and needs to redraw the entire menu.            The whichItem parameter is actually a pointer to a MenuTrackingData structure. On entry,            the menu field of this structure is valid. The menu definition should draw the menu and,            if it supports scrolling, should also fill in the virtualMenuTop and virtualMenuBottom            fields of the structure to indicate the menu's initial unscrolled position; typically,             virtualMenuTop would be set to the same value as the top coordinate of the menu rect,            and virtualMenuBottom would be set to virtualMenuTop plus the virtual height of the menu.                        If the menu definition uses QuickDraw to draw, it should draw into the current port.                If the menu definition uses CoreGraphics to draw, it should use the CGContextRef passed            in the context field of the MDEFDrawData structure.                    kMenuSizeMsg                    menuRect        unused            hitPt           maximum width and height of the menu            whichItem       unused                        Sent when the Menu Manager needs to determine the size of a menu. The menu definition            should calculate the width and height of the menu and store the sizes into the menu with            SetMenuWidth and SetMenuHeight.                        If the gestaltMenuMgrSendsMenuBoundsToDefProc bit is set in the Menu Manager's Gestalt            value, then the hitPt parameter to this message is the maximum width (hitPt.h) and height            (hitPt.v) of the menu. The menu definition should ensure that the width and height that it            places in the menu do not exceed these values. If the gestalt bit is not set, the menu            definition should just use the main GDevice's width and height as constraints on the menu's            width and height.                    kMenuPopUpMsg                    menuRect        on entry, constraints on the menu's position; on exit, menu bounds            hitPt           requested menu location, with swapped coordinates            whichItem       on entry, requested initial selection; on exit, virtual menu top                        Sent when the Menu Manager is about to display a popup menu. The menu definition should            calculate the appropriate menu bounds to contain the menu based on the requested menu            location and selected item. It should write the menuBounds into the rect given by the            menuRect parameter.                        If the gestaltMenuMgrSendsMenuBoundsToDefProc bit is set in the Menu Manager's Gestalt            value, then the menuRect parameter on entry to this message contains a constraint rect,            in global coordinates, outside of which the popup menu should not be positioned. The menu            definition should take this constraint rect into account as it calculates the menu bounds.            If the gestalt bit is not set, the menu definition should use the bounds of the GDevice            containing the menu's top left corner as a constraint on the menu's position.                        The hitPt parameter is a requested location for the top left corner of the menu. The            coordinates of this parameter are swapped from their normal order; the h field of the            hitPt parameter contains the vertical coordinate, and the v field of hitPt contains            the horizontal coordinate.                        On entry, the whichItem parameter points at a menu item index which is requested to be            the initial selection when the menu is displayed. After calculating the menu's bounds,            the menu definition should write the menu's virtual top coordinate into the location            pointed at by the whichItem parameter. If displaying the menu at the requested location            does not require scrolling, the virtual top will be the same as the menu bounds top;            if the menu must scroll to fit in the requested location, the virtual top may be different.                    kMenuCalcItemMsg                    menuRect        on exit, item bounds            hitPt           unused            whichItem       the item whose rect to calculate                        Sent when the Menu Manager needs to know the bounds of a menu item. The menu definition            should calculate the size of the item specified by the whichItem parameter, and store             the bounds in the rect specified by the menuRect parameter.                        Some sample menu definition code provided by Apple has previously shown an implementation            of this message that always sets the top left corner of the item bounds to (0,0), regardless            of the item's actual position in the menu. For best future compatibility, menu definitions            should begin storing an item bounds that gives the item's actual position in the menu based            on the menu's current virtual top. For example, if the virtual menu top starts at 20, then            the menu definition would calculate an item bounds for the first item that starts at (0,20),            an item bounds for the second item that starts at (0,40), and so on. The menu definition            should call GetMenuTrackingData to get the menu's current virtual position, and use zero            for the menu top if GetMenuTrackingData returns an error.                    kMenuThemeSavvyMsg                    menuRect        unused            hitPt           unused            whichItem       on exit, indicates theme-savvyness of the menu definition                        Sent by the Menu Manager to determine whether the MDEF uses the Appearance Manager             menu-drawing functions to draw its menu. If it does, the menu definition should return            kThemeSavvyMenuResponse in the location pointed to by whichItem. If the menu definition            draws its own custom content without using the Appearance Manager menu-drawing functions,            it should ignore this message.        Low-memory Global Replacements            Pre-Carbon menu definitions needed to use several low-memory globals to communicate with the        Menu Manager. These globals have all been replaced or made obsolete in Carbon, as follows:                MenuDisable                        MenuDisable is now set automatically by the Menu Manager using the value returned in the            itemUnderMouse field of the MenuTrackingData structure passed to kMenuFindItemMsg.                    TopMenuItem        AtMenuBottom                    TopMenuItem and AtMenuBottom are now set automatically by the Menu Manager using the            values returned in the virtualMenuTop and virtualMenuBottom fields of the MenuTrackingData            structure passed to kMenuDrawMsg and kMenuFindItemMsg.                    mbSaveLoc                This undocumented low-memory global was used by pre-Carbon menu definitions to store            the bounding rect of the currently selected item and to avoid drawing glitches while            the menu definition was scrolling the contents of a menu that had submenus. The Menu            Manager now automatically sets the selected item bounds using the value returned in            the itemRect field of the MenuTrackingData structure passed to kMenuFindItemMsg. In            order to correctly support scrolling of menus with submenus, a menu definition should            verify, before scrolling the menu contents, that no submenus of the scrolling menu are            currently visible. A menu definition can use GetMenuTrackingData to verify this condition,            as follows:                            Boolean SafeToScroll( MenuRef menuBeingScrolled )                {                    MenuTrackingData lastMenuData;                    return GetMenuTrackingData( NULL, &lastMenuData ) == noErr                           && lastMenuData.menu == menuBeingScrolled;                }                        If SafeToScroll returns false, the menu definition should not scroll the menu.*/begin enum/* menu defProc messages */_kMenuDrawMsg                  = 0_kMenuSizeMsg                  = 2_kMenuPopUpMsg                 = 3/* position the popup menu rect appropriately */_kMenuCalcItemMsg              = 5_kMenuThemeSavvyMsg            = 7/* is your MDEF theme-savvy?
