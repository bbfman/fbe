<hr>

FBtoC corrects a design mistake in FB (apparently inherited from Applesoft BASIC) that made for/next loops always execute at least once. Compatibility with legacy FB code can be obtained by overriding a special predefined constant as shown below.
<pre class="codeexample">
dim as long  j
for j = 1 to 0
 print "Never get here"
next

override _forLoopsAlwaysExecuteAtLeastOnce = _true

for j = 1 to 0
 print "Get here" // legacy FB behavior
next

override _forLoopsAlwaysExecuteAtLeastOnce = _false

for j = 1 to 0
 print "Never get here"
next
</pre>
