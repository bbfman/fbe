<hr>

<p>The default behaviour of HandleEvents is now to block (i.e. not return) until an event is dispatched. 
<p>In FB4 the default behaviour was to return after every 2&nbsp;ticks (1&nbsp;tick = 1/60 s) even when no events occurred. In effect a steam of null events was generated 30 times a second, allowing polling but wasting CPU time.
This (typically unwanted) activity could be suppressed by:
<pre class="codeexample">
poke long event - 8, 0xFFFFFFFF // no null events, thanks
</pre>

<p>In FB5/FBtoC it is no longer necessary to suppress null events in this way.

<p>The old FB4 behaviour, if required, can be restored as shown: 
<pre class="codeexample">
poke long event - 8, 2 // null events every 2 ticks, like FB4
do
 fn PollRegularlyForSomething
 HandleEvents
until gFBQuit
</pre>
