<p><b>FBtoC Preferences Settings</b>
<br>The Settings dialog is self-documenting by virtue of the titles, help tags, and grouping of the controls:
<p><img src="../gfx/settings.jpg">

<p><b>UserFloatPrefs settings</b>
<br>The FB compiler reads a little-known file UserFloatPrefs (typically in User Libraries) to determine four settings. FBtoC does not attempt to read UserFloatPrefs. Of the four settings, only _RoundUpFloat2Long is supported in FBtoC. 
<p><table>
<tr><td width="300">_NumberLeadingSpace</td><td width="140">Not supported</td><td>always ON</td></tr>
<tr><td>_FBAllowNAN</td><td>Not supported</td><td>always ON</td></tr>
<tr><td>_RoundUpFloat2Long</td><td>Supported</td><td>initially OFF  &#134;</td></tr>
<tr><td>_FBEnableMenuChoice</td><td>Irrelevant</td></tr>
</table>


<p>&#134; To force FBtoC to round conversions from float to integer, place this statement near the top of your code,  before any calculations:

<pre class="codeexample">
<b>override</b> _RoundUpFloat2Long = _true // float->int conversions, from here on, are rounded to nearest
</pre>
<p>FB takes no notice of this statement, because it has already determined the setting by reading UserFloatPrefs. Once rounding is enabled in a project, it cannot be turned off by further overriding _RoundUpFloat2Long; this behaviour matches FB.

<p><b>Making a console application</b>
<br>'ConsoleWindow' option <i>removed</i> in FB 5.7.102
<br>To build a text-only console app, similar to FBtoC's Console, place this at the start of your code:

<pre class="codeexample">
<b>include</b> "ConsoleWindow"
</pre>
<p>In console mode, print commands are directed to a scrolling text window.
