In * Mac OS X 10.2 and later, most common user interface objects * (controls, windows, menus, and toolbars) are derived from * HIObject. Code which is external to HIToolbox can also create its * own subclasses of our objects using the routines contained in * this file. There are also polymorphic functions one can use on * any HIObject for getting the class ID, etc.  *  * HIObjects are actually CF types under the hood. This means that * they can be put into CF collections and retain/release can be * called on them.  *  * An HIObject is essentially a very basic building-block object * which contains an event target. You can create these objects to * use as your own Carbon Event receptors in your application, or * you can subclass existing Toolbox object to suit your needs. *  *  * You register your subclasses with HIObjectRegisterSubclass, * passing your class ID, the parent class, and an event handler. * You also pass a list of events the handler is interested in. *  *  * To create an object of your subclass, you call HIObjectCreate, * passing the class ref you registered, as well as an * initialization event.  *  * Construction is two-phase: first the basic construction of the * object is done, then initialization is performed. The toolbox * sends construction events bottom-up, as you would expect in C++ * or the like. Here is the list of what goes on to create an * object:  *  * 1) The Toolbox creates the base HIObject  *  * 2) It then installs the event handler you specified when you * registered your subclass. Your handler must listen for * kEventHIObjectConstruct and kEventHIObjectDestruct events. If it * does not, the class cannot be registered (you will get a * paramErr).  *  * 3) Next, the Toolbox _directly_ calls your handler with an * kEventHIObjectConstruct event. When called like this, you are not * really being called in the context of a handler stack, so you * cannot do things like CallNextEventHandler. The userData * parameter is what you specified when you registered the class. * Typically, during construction you will allocate memory yourself * to store your own instance data; this allocation might be as * simple as calling malloc or NewPtr, or it might involve creating * your own C++ object. In the construct event, you are passed the * base HIObjectRef of the object being created. Typically you would * store this HIObjectRef in your own instance data for later use. * When handling this construct event, you should be sure to use * SetEventParameter to set the kEventParamHIObjectInstance * parameter in the construction event with your own instance data. * You must use typeVoidPtr as the type.  *  * 4) The Toolbox looks for your instance of typeVoidPtr after you * handle the construct event. It then takes that data and stores it * off with the object and also sets the user data of the event * handler it installed to be this instance data. This means that * following the construct event, all calls to your event handler * will have the instance data you returned to us.  *  * 5) Once construction has completed successfully, we will send * your object the initialize event passed into HIObjectCreate. At * this point, all events are now sent to your object using standard * Carbon Events mechanisms (it is only the construct event which is * special). When we send the initialization event to your subclass, * you should pass the event to your superclass before proceeding. * You do this with CallNextEventHandler. Once back from that call, * you should verify that the result is noErr, indicating that the * superclass did in fact initialize properly. If it did not, your * should return the error that CallNextEventHandler returned from * your handler as well. The object will be destroyed by the * Toolbox. Your object should be able to be destroyed in a * partially initialized state such as this. This stage is optional, * i.e. an object does not need to respond to the initialize event * unless it is expecting certain parameters to be passed to it at * creation time. This is where those parameters can be fetched. *  *  * 6) Once initialization is successful, the HIObjectRef is * returned to the caller of HIObjectCreate. From there, you can * have all sorts of cool fun.  *  * When someone has called CFRelease enough such that the refcount * of the object drops to zero, the object is destroyed. The Toolbox * will send a kEventHIObjectDestruct event to your object. DO NOT * CALL CALLNEXTEVENTHANDLER. You will be setting yourself up for * some hurt. Just clean up and return from your handler.*/// typedef struct OpaqueHIObjectClassRef* HIObjectClassRef;// typedef struct OpaqueHIObjectRef* HIObjectRef;#define HIObjectClassRef as pointer // to OpaqueHIObjectClassRef#define HIObjectRef as pointer // to OpaqueHIObjectRef/*--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*//* ¥ Constants *//*--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*//* * Discussion: * HIObject errors*/begin enum not output/** You are trying to register a class ID that already exists.*/_hiObjectClassExistsErr             = -22080 /** You are trying to unregister a class which has instances which* still exist.
